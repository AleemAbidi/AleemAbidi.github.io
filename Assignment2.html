    <h1 ALIGN=Center>Fair Usage and Copyright</h1>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<BLOCKQUOTE><p>In today's world, copyright is more important than ever. Almost anything is able to be found online, whether it is illegal to be there and shared or not. Copyright helps us have some set of rules in place on what can be taken with or without the original creator's consent. This way no one should be able to take the work of others. That is not always the case though. There are a number of issues with current copyright rules. Issues include jurisdiction in other countries, fair use and enforcement of such laws among other things. Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed to work set of rules right now. Reasons for this include simply these rules not being enforced enough, to what countries which don't follow another countries set of laws, or don't even have any laws regarding the issue.</p>
	
	<p>When talking about issues like copyright law and fair use, the difference between private and public use is an issue, and so is what falls under public use as compared to what is considered private use. I believe instances such as a teacher using a copyright restricted song or movie in class should not be restricted because the public, which is the students, are benefiting from the work which is backed up by the material. But a student should not be able to take directly copy and paste from someone else's work because it is for the student's personal gain. Instances such as someone taking copyright restricted material, such as a song and uploading it to YouTube under their account should be restricted and removed because the only one benefiting from it and receiving potential ad revenue is the uploader, not the creator. The rights to use copyrighted material for commercial use should and remain how it is now, people should be able to use copyrighted material if they pay for the rights to use it, whether that it be used in major Hollywood movie or a low budget commercial. As long as there is no one person taking material for their own personal gain, such as receiving revenue for using material they don't own, and it benefits the public, copyrighted material should be able to be used to a certain degree. There are cases such as sites which using content in articles, which do help the public as long as the original creator is referenced and sourced. But there are unique cases that could fall into a grey area. For example, a news website uses a YouTube video in their article. That should be okay as long as they embedded the video using YouTube's own embedding tools because any advertisement that run on the embedded video will go to the original creator, not the news website. But if the site were to download the video onto their own servers without the consent of the original creator and show it that way, that should not be okay because any advertisement revenue generated will go to the website, not the content creator.</p>
	
	<p>In today's day and age content creators can make a living and be successful through the internet. Someone who is a popular video creator, whether that be YouTube, Twitch, or other similar platforms, can very well make a lot of money through making digital content. That itself is an issue because that type of content is very easy to copy and take credit for. Whether that be a music file, video or computer applications. There are some ways to stop people from having their content stolen, but they each have their advantages and disadvantages. Computer algorithms are becoming better at detecting copyright protected music for example, but people do find ways around that. Piracy with pc games and applications are big issue due to ease of downloading and sharing files. This is mainly an issue when developers take DRM to extreme levels which doesn't always work and allows pirates to eventually find ways around it, but also punish the user who buys the game or application legitimately and is supporting the developer. Someone is very likely to find ways around copyright protection measures fairly quick after launch. </p>
	
	<p>Another matter surrounding the issue of copyright and fair usage is areas of the world which have a different set of laws for copyright. For example, there are some countries which do not follow a set of laws regarding copyright, such as Tuvalu. Does Tuvalu have to follow rules set by the other countries? Can someone in Tuvalu illegally download files and get away with it? What about a file hosted in a server in a country which has a different set of laws in place? While there is no clear answer to all these answers and there is no one way to deal with these problems, there should be some kind of universal law regarding this matter. The problem with something like that is not everyone will be onboard with the idea, and it could be quite difficult to enforce. Also every nation would have to have like minded thoughts on the matter, which is also highly unlikely. That is why this topic can be a very confusing one. There are currently rules set in place, albeit they need some work and enforcement, but it could be quite sometime until a real, clear solution is found.</p>
	
	<p>Over the past few years, some forms of traditional media have been dying out. The biggest one being television subscriptions. Slowly people have been canceling their subscriptions simply because you pay a lot for maybe only a few networks you'll actually watch. There are other reasons for people cancelling, one being how easy it is to illegally download your favourite TV shows and movies. Besides sending DCMA takedown notices to file hosting sites and alerting ISPs of customers who are downloading their material illegally, the companies are pretty limited in what they can do to prevent all of this. Another big reason for cancelling is the wealth in today's online video communities such as YouTube. Today, people could be entertained by online videos of cats, informational videos and even someone playing video games in front of a webcam. Aside from the cost of internet, all the user has to do is watch advertisements. When it is as easy as it is to upload someone else's work and claim it as your own, copyright becomes a huge factor in the online world. Most online content creators will get the bulk of their revenue through advertisements playing on their content. By monetizing their content, people can make a decent to extremely high amount of money through online content creation. There are ways to get around that, like AdBlock.  I personally use AdBlock, but disable it for sites such as YouTube, Twitch and other sites where I want to support the content creator and hopefully encourage them to put out more content. So when its this easy to download someone else's work and upload it as your own, it is even more important to have proper copyright tools in place to help combat this issue. It is getting better, where algorithms can detect copyrighted content in the audio track of a video stream, or even a simple and fast method to alert and mark a video as stolen so the site can act on it. </p>
	
	<p>In a perfect world, everyone would follow the rules and play fairly, that unfortunately is not the case. There should be some sort of worldwide standard regarding fair use, what is applicable under these laws, length of period before content is copyright free and many other issues surrounding this very complicated and very important topic. That may never work out though because every country has their own idea and therefore their own rules regarding the matter. The one thing that will be helpful going forward is the tools that are provided and the companies that combat copyright infringement. In most cases they would likely act a lot quicker than government on takedowns and putting forward their own rules that enforce fair usage and protect content creators.</p></BLOCKQUOTE>
