	<h1>Steps Taken to Produce this Godly Image</h1>
	<ul>
	<p> Quite alot tools were used and steps taken to produce this image</p>
	<li id="list2"> 1. The enitre original image was copied and taken into a blank .psd file</li>
	<li id="list2"> 2. A combination of the polygonal and magic lasso tool were used to delete background and only leave Brian in image. The eraser tool was used for the remainder, I even went as far as erasing on the one pixel level to acheive the effect to my liking.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 3. The phone was then removed from the photo, some of the fingers had to be rebuilt using the brush and eyedropper tools.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 4. Artifacts from the original image were present on the coat, they were smusdges on the mirror. I use the the Rectangular Marquee to select the individual artifacts and then applied a Content-Aware fill on top. The result was quite good.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 5. An image of generic stars and space were acquired and inserted into a new layer and acted as the background. The same image was copied and pasted a few times to fill the entire canvas.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 6. A high resolution stock photo of Earth from NASA was acquired and inserted into the image as its own layer.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 7. The fingers were copied to a new layer and moved to show Brian grasping the Earth. Some fingers were cut to show depth.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 8. Eyes were coloured in via pencil and multiple colours, pupil was darker for effect.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 9. Laser beams were added as their own layers, then Free Transform was used to make the lasers aim at the Earth. Free Transform was also used to make left laser join up with right mid way.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 10. Blur tool was used to make the point where lasers met seem more natural.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 11. Lasers were then made slightly transparent using Layer Blending Tools.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 12. The body and hands were tweaked using Auto Colour and Auto Contrast. Fine tuning with Brightness and Contrast was used afterwards.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 13. Image Levels were then tweaked to make Brian more darker and look more menacing.</li>
	<li id="list2"> 14. Image was exported to a .png file. Final image was then resized.</li>
