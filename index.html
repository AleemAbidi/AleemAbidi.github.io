	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>My name is Syed Abidi, though I go by Aleem, not Syed. I am a second year Computer Science student at Trent University. Despite of that, I suck at HTML. ALOT.</p>
	<p>I'm fine with other languages, just not HTML. Been that way since high school.</p>
	<p>...I don't know what else to put here... I'm 19 years old, was born in Pakistan, love games, movies, technology, you know, the usual stuff.</p>
	<p>Apologies for the eyesore that is this site.</p>
